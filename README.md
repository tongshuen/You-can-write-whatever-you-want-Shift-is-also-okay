You can write anything and then submit it with PR, really anything: ruby or shift (remove f).It can even be used as a blog or a diary (do not write your credit card password)🤓👍If you don't want to write anything, you can put cat food on the keyboard and let your cat create it. Remember to attach a photo of it.
