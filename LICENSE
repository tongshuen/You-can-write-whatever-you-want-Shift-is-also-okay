Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious big dick license V1.0
                   (c) 2025 童顺
Terms and Conditions 
1. You can:
You are free to copy, modify, and distribute 
this code, and even claim that you wrote it 
yourself (but your conscience may hurt).
◦ Use the code anywhere, including but not 
limited to:
    ◦Let your cat learn programming
    ◦ Launch the rocket (at your own risk)
    ◦ Make a time machine (remember to invite 
me to dinner when you come back)
2. You cannot:
◦ Because the code ran out to sue me (I said
this code is provided "as is").
◦ Use the code for evil purposes (e.g., 
automatically generate boss's "encouragement 
to work overtime" emails).
◦ Commercial use without giving me 
likes/coins/reposts (just kidding, feel free
to use it).
3. Additional terms:
◦ If you modify the code and make a lot of 
money, theoretically you should buy the 
original 
author a cup of milk tea, but legally you don't
have to.
Of course, this license is purely for entertainment,
you 
can do whatever you want as long as you don't 
destroy the Earth.
